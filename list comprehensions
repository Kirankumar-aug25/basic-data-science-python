list comprehensions
it is another way for creating list and reduce the size of a code 

for loop vs list comprehensions

x = []
for i in range (11)
	x.append(i)
print(x)
## usinglist comprehension
x =[i for i in range(11)]
print(x)
we can use list comprehension in list,sets,dictonaries and cannot be used in tuples because tuple is immutable.

2 example

 x = "i want to become a machine learning engineer"
 x_list = []
 for j in x:
     x_list.append(j)
  print(x_list)

# conditional vs list comprehension

x = "i want to become a machine learning engineer"
x_list = [char for char in x if char in "aeiou"]

print(x_list)

vs
x = "i want to become a machine learning engineer"

for j in x:

    if j in "aeiou":
        print(j,end=" ")
    else:
        print(0,end=" ")
	
	vs 
	
	x = "i want to become a machine learning engineer"
x_list = [char for char in x  if char in "aeiou"]
print("the list of vowels=", x_list)
print( "the lenght =",len(x_list))
