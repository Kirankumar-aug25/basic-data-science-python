list comprehensions
it is another way for creating list and reduce the size of a code 

for loop vs list comprehensions

x = []
for i in range (11)
	x.append(i)
print(x)
## usinglist comprehension
x =[i for i in range(11)]
print(x)
we can use list comprehension in list,sets,dictonaries and cannot be used in tuples because tuple is immutable.

# conditional vs list comprehension
